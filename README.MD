# getting logs for Allure TestOps in docker-compose deployment

## How

1. Clone this very rep to your machine - `git clone https://github.com/cheshi-mantu/shell-scripts-testops.git`
2. Copy `get-logs.sh` to docker-compose config files directory
   - this is the directory where you have `.env` and `docker-compose.yml`
   - scripts needs to be in the same folder as the files above to get Allure TestOps release installed from `.env`
   - scripts needs to be in the same folder to get services names from docker-compose.yml
3. Make get-logs.sh executable `chmod +x get-logs.sh`
4. Run the script `./get-logs.sh`
5. collect the **tar.gz** file generated by the script and attach to a tech support ticket.
